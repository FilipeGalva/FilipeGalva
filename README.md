- Hi, I’m @FilipeGalva 👋 
- I’m interested in regenerative technologies and the possibilities of designing a synergistic planetary way of life
          through new procedures (algorithms, culture, dynamics between living species and technology).
          I'm also interested in game design, AI, Data Science and IoT. 👀 
- I’m currently learning Python, HTML, JavaScript and ReactJS. 🌱 
- I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Data journalism, game design, speculative research, and so on. 💞️ 
- How to reach me: filipe.ferreira.galvao@gmail.com 📫
